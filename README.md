1) Run the anon.sh script to create an anonymized layout of folders without any names.
2) Go to Google Drive and create a PA grading folder with three folders inside: one for Ephraim, Ming, and Zach.
3) Upload 1/3 of the folders for each of us.
4) Create a Google Sheet based on class roster but replace the names and emails with student1, student2, etc. The order in which the submissions are downloaded will be the same as the class roster. Make sure to heep their ID so you can still do an automatic import into Moodle. 
6) Run the plagarism.sh script to build the correct format to import into DOLOS: https://dolos.ugent.be/
