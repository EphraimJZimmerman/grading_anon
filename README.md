1) Run the anon.sh script to create an anonymized layout of folders without any names.
2) Go to Google Drive and create a PA grading folder with three folders inside: one for Ephraim, Ming, and Zach.
3) Upload 1/3 of the PA submissions for each of us.
4) Create a Google Sheet derviced from class roster but replace the names and emails with student1, student2, etc. The order in which the submissions are downloaded will be the same as the class roster so the grading will match up. Make sure to heep their ID so you can still do an automatic import into Moodle. 
6) Run the plagarism.sh script to build the correct format to import into DOLOS: https://dolos.ugent.be/ (make sure to select Python to filter out the other files uploaded with them)
